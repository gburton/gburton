## Why I Built Phoenix: An eCommerce Platform That Respects Developers
_By Gary (gburton), Founder of Phoenix Cart_

If you've ever tried building an online store, you know the pain.  You start optimistic, then quickly hit walls: bloated platforms, confusing plugin ecosystems, locked-in SaaS models, and slow, clunky performance that kills your creativity — and your user experience.

**That frustration is exactly why I built Phoenix Cart.**

# The Problem: eCommerce Platforms Are Stuck in the Past

For years, merchants and developers have been forced to choose between:

+ **Lock-in with SaaS platforms like Shopify** — easy to start, but costly and limiting as you grow.
+ **Overwhelming, messy open-source options like WooCommerce or Magento** — powerful but bloated, complex, and hard to maintain.

Neither approach feels truly modern or developer-friendly. The tools often work against you, rather than empowering you to build something great.

# My Vision: A Platform That Respects Your Craft

I wanted to build an eCommerce platform that:

+ **Gives you full ownership** of your store, data, and code — no surprises, no backdoors.
+ **Is lightweight and performant** out of the box, so your customers enjoy blazing-fast shopping.
+ **Lets developers and designers extend and customize freely**, without wrestling with poorly documented hacks or plugin chaos.
+ **Supports a curated, community-driven addon ecosystem**, rather than a wild marketplace full of low-quality extensions.

# Why "Phoenix"?

Like the mythical bird, Phoenix Cart is about **rising from the ashes** of legacy platforms — fresh, powerful, and built to last.

It's designed for builders, tinkerers, and merchants who demand more than cookie-cutter SaaS or a plugin jungle.
